# High Score System - Admin Implementation Guide

## Overview

The High Score system implements time-based competition periods with automatic winner selection and reward management. This guide covers all admin-specific endpoints and functionalities for managing the leaderboard system.

## Authentication

All admin endpoints require Admin JWT authentication:
```
Authorization: Bearer <admin_jwt_token>
```

Admin authentication uses Google OAuth with JWT tokens that include `jwtSecureCode` for token revocation capabilities.

## Base URL

All endpoints are prefixed with: `/api/high_score`

## Admin Endpoints

### 3. System Management

**Description:** Processes all expired periods, selects winners, and creates new periods if auto-restart is enabled. Normally executed by cron job.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "processedCount": 2,
    "results": [
      {
        "periodId": "period-1-uuid",
        "winnersCount": 1,
        "newPeriodCreated": true
      },
      {
        "periodId": "period-2-uuid",
        "winnersCount": 0,
        "newPeriodCreated": false
      }
    ]
  },
  "message": "2 periodos procesados"
}
```

## Implementation Flow

### 1. Initial Setup
1. Create periods for each game using `POST /periods`
2. Set appropriate duration (typically 7 days)
3. Enable auto-restart for continuous competitions

### 2. Monitoring Competitions
1. Use `GET /periods` to monitor active periods
2. Check `GET /periods/<id>/winners` to see current standings
3. Use `GET /winners` for historical analysis

### 3. Manual Intervention
1. `PUT /periods/<id>` to modify period settings
2. `POST /periods/<id>/close` for emergency closures
3. `POST /process-expired` to manually trigger period processing

### 4. Reward Management
1. Monitor `GET /winners` for unclaimed rewards (`reward_claimed: false`)
2. Use `POST /winners/<id>/mark-claimed` when users collect rewards
3. Track reward distribution metrics

## Business Logic

### Period Lifecycle
1. **Active Period**: Users can submit scores
2. **Period Expiration**: Automatically processed by scheduler
3. **Winner Selection**: Top positions become winners
4. **New Period**: Auto-created if `auto_restart: true`

### Winner Selection
- Only users with scores are eligible
- Ties are resolved by earliest `achieved_at` timestamp
- Number of winners determined by `topPositions` parameter

### Automatic Processing
- Scheduler runs every 60 minutes in production
- Processes expired periods automatically
- Creates new periods based on `auto_restart` setting

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses

**401 Unauthorized:**
```json
{
  "error": "No autorizado"
}
```

**400 Bad Request:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "gameId y durationDays son obligatorios"
}
```

**500 Internal Server Error:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error interno del servidor"
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Period Management
- Create periods in advance to avoid gaps
- Use consistent duration across games
- Monitor active periods regularly

### 2. Reward Management
- Check for unclaimed rewards daily
- Mark rewards as claimed promptly
- Track reward distribution statistics

### 3. System Maintenance
- Monitor `POST /process-expired` for failures
- Set up alerts for processing errors
- Regularly review winner selection accuracy

### 4. Security
- Always validate admin authentication
- Log all administrative actions
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Period Statistics**:
   - Average participants per period
   - Score distributions
   - Period completion rates

2. **Winner Statistics**:
   - Reward claim rates
   - Time between winning and claiming
   - Repeat winners analysis

3. **System Health**:
   - Period processing success rate
   - API endpoint response times
   - Error rates by endpoint

### Recommended Dashboards
1. Active competitions status
2. Pending rewards awaiting collection
3. Historical winner trends
4. System processing metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Period Not Closing Automatically:**
- Check if scheduler is running
- Verify period end_date is in the past
- Run `POST /process-expired` manually

**Winners Not Selected:**
- Ensure users have submitted scores
- Check for database connectivity issues
- Verify period has expired

**Auto-restart Not Working:**
- Confirm `auto_restart: true` in period settings
- Check scheduler execution logs
- Verify game_id exists for new period

### Emergency Procedures

**Manual Period Closure:**
```http
POST /api/high_score/periods/<id>/close
```

**Force Period Processing:**
```http
POST /api/high_score/process-expired
```

**Extend Period Duration:**
```http
PUT /api/high_score/periods/<id>
{
  "end_date": "2024-01-30T23:59:59Z"
}
```

## API Testing

### Using cURL

**Get all periods:**
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.domain.com/api/high_score/periods" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>"
```

**Create new period:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.domain.com/api/high_score/periods" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "gameId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "durationDays": 7,
    "autoRestart": true
  }'
```

**Mark reward as claimed:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.domain.com/api/high_score/winners/<winner-id>/mark-claimed" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>"
```
